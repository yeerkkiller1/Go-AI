[Thank You Speech]
I'd like to thank the developers and the community of The Open Toolkit library for their all-time support and precious help.
I'd also like to thank everyone that has bothered to fill in a bug report/feature request, has posted a patch/solution or just dropped a few encouraging lines.
Much appreciated.
