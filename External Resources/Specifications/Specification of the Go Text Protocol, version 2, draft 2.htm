</p><h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000">
1 Introduction</a>
</h1>
This document gives a specification of the Go Text Protocol (GTP),
version 2.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000">
1.1 Purpose of the Protocol</a>
</h2>

<p>
The intention of GTP is to provide a flexible and easy to implement
communication protocol for go programs. The main purpose is to allow
two programs to play each other but it is also useful for regression
testing and communication with a GUI or a go server. Most use cases
require an external support program, but this can be shared between
all programs with GTP support.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00022000000000000000">
1.2 History</a>
</h2>
The Go Text Protocol was developed within the GNU Go project,
initially to create a framework for automated regression testing and
to simplify connecting the program to go servers. The first appearance
of the protocol was on May 18, 2000, in GNU Go development version
2.7.95. The first stable release of GNU Go with GTP support was GNU Go
3.0.0, released August 24, 2001, which is the reference implementation
for version 1 of the protocol. There is no good specification of GTP
version 1, however, and this document is intended to provide one for
version 2.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00023000000000000000"></a>
<a name="sec:communication-model"></a>
<br>
1.3 Communication Model
</h2>
The protocol is asymmetric and involves two parties, which we call
controller and engine. The controller is typically some kind of
arbiter or relay and the engine is typically a go playing program. All
communication is initiated by the controller in form of commands, to
which the engine responds.

<p>
The communication channel is assumed to be free from errors (i.e. 
those are handled at a lower level). Examples are UNIX pipes or TCP/IP
connections. The latter can also be established over an error prone
modem connection by using PPP (Point to Point Protocol) as a transport
layer.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00024000000000000000">
1.4 Typical Use Cases</a>
</h2>

<ol>
<li>Regression testing. 
<br>
controller (regression script) -- engine 
<br>
The controller sets up a board position and asks the engine to e.g. 
  generate a move.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Human vs program. 
<br>
controller (GUI) -- engine 
<br>
The controller relays moves between the human and the engine and
  asks the engine to generate moves.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Program vs program with arbiter. 
<br>
engine 1 -- controller (arbiter) -- engine 2 
<br>
The controller relays moves between the two engines and alternately
  asks the engines to generate moves. This involves two different GTP
  channels, the first between the controller and engine 1, and the
  second between the controller and engine 2. There is no direct
  communication between the two engines. The controller dictates board
  size, komi, etc.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Program vs program without arbiter. 
<br>
The same as above except that engine 1 includes the controller
  functionality and the first GTP link is shortcut.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Connection between go server and program. 
<br>
go server -- controller (relay) -- engine 
<br>
The controller talks to a go server using whatever protocol is
  needed and listens for match requests. When one arrives it accepts
  it, starts the go engine and issues GTP commands to set up board
  size, komi, etc. and if a game is restarted it also sets up the
  position. Then it relays moves between the server and the engine and
  asks the engine to generate new moves when it is in turn.
</li>
</ol>

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00025000000000000000">
1.5 Reference Implementation</a>
</h2>
The reference implementation for GTP version 2 is GNU Go version 3.4.
In cases of incompleteness or unclarity in this specification, the
reference implementation decides the correct behaviour. Notice,
however, that any command available in GNU Go 3.4, but not included in
this specification (full list in section <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:commands">6</a>), is to be
considered a private extension (see section
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:private-extensions">2.13</a>).

<p>
Temporary comment: GNU Go 3.4 is currently under development and GTP
version 2 has not yet been implemented in the development versions.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000"></a>
<a name="sec:character-set"></a>
<br>
2.1 Character Set
</h2>
All messages exchanged in this protocol are to be considered as 8-bit
character sequences. Only characters in the US-ASCII character set
(ANSI X3.4-1986) are used for standardized commands and responses.
Other characters may be used in comments (section <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:comments">2.9</a>)
and private extensions (section <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:private-extensions">2.13</a>) but
there is no preferred character set specified for those.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000">
2.2 Control Characters</a>
</h2>
Character values 0-31 and 127 are control characters in ASCII. The
following control characters have a specific meaning in the
protocol:
<br>
<p>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>HT</tt> (dec 9)</td>
<td align="LEFT">Horizontal Tab</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>CR</tt> (dec 13)</td>
<td align="LEFT">Carriage Return</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>LF</tt> (dec 10)</td>
<td align="LEFT">Line Feed</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
</p><p>
All other control characters must be discarded on input and should not
be used on output.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00033000000000000000"></a>
<a name="sec:whitespace"></a>
<br>
2.3 Whitespace
</h2>
The following ASCII characters can be used to indicate whitespace in
the protocol:
<br>
<p>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>SPACE</tt> (dec 32)</td>
<td align="LEFT">Space</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>HT</tt> (dec 9)</td>
<td align="LEFT">Horizontal Tab</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
</p><p>
In the rest of the specification we use 'space' to denote a whitespace
character. On input this may be either a SPACE or a HT. On output only a
SPACE should be used.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00034000000000000000"></a>
<a name="sec:newline-convention"></a>
<br>
2.4 Newline Convention
</h2>
A newline is indicated by a single LF character. Any occurence of a CR
character must be discarded on input, both by the engine and the
controller. On output either LF or some combination of CR and LF can
be used. In syntax descriptions we use <code>\n</code> to indicate a newline.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00035000000000000000">
2.5 Command Structure</a>
</h2>
A command is exactly one line long, with the syntax

<p>
</p><pre>[id] command_name [arguments]
</pre>

<p>
Here <tt>id</tt> is an optional identity number and
<tt>command_name</tt> a string. The rest of the line (up to the first
newline) gives the arguments of the command.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00036000000000000000">
2.6 Response Structure</a>
</h2>
If successful, the engine returns a response of the form

<p>
</p><pre>=[id] result
</pre>

<p>
Here '<tt>=</tt>' indicates success, <tt>id</tt> is the identity
number given in the command, and <tt>result</tt> is a piece of text

2.8 Timing
</h2>
There are no synchronization requirements between the controller and the
engine. The controller may send commands at any time, regardless of
whether it has obtained responses for previous commands. The engine may
send responses whenever they are ready. It must, however, respond to the
commands in the same order as they come in. The engine is allowed to
make pauses while sending a response.

2.9 Comments
</h2>
Comments can be included in the command stream. All text between a
hash sign (<tt>#</tt>) and the following newline is considered as
comments and should be discarded on input.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000310000000000000000">
2.10 Empty lines</a>
</h2>
Empty lines and lines with only whitespace sent by the controller must
be ignored by the engine. No response must be generated. Empty lines and
lines with only whitespace sent by the engine and occuring outside a
response must be ignored by the controller. Notice that pure comment
lines will appear as empty lines after the comment has been discarded.

<br>
2.11 Board Coordinates
</h2>
Board intersections, in this document called vertices, are encoded by a
letter plus a number. On a 19x19 board the letters go from A to T,
excluding I, from the left to the right. The numbers go from 1 to 19,
from the bottom to the top. Thus the lower left corner is called A1, the
lower right corner T1, the upper left corner A19, and the upper right
corner T19. Smaller boards use the obvious subset of these coordinates.
Larger boards, up to 25x25, are handled by extending the letters with U
to Z as needed. Boards larger than 25x25 are not supported by the
protocol.

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000312000000000000000">
2.12 Protocol Subsets</a>
</h2>
An engine does not have to implement all commands listed in this
specification. In general, for an engine to be used with some specific
controller, it is only required that the engine understands exactly the
commands needed by that controller. To simplify this matching of
capabilities, there are two predefined protocol subsets called the
tournament and the regression subsets. There is also a small set of
commands required for all GTP supporting engines.

<a name="sec:private-extensions"></a>
<br>
2.13 Private Extensions
</h2>
The protocol is trivial to extend with new commands. Obviously there is
a risk for conflicts if multiple engines make incompatible private
extensions of the protocol or if an engine makes a private extension
which turns out to be incompatible with a future extension of the
standard protocol.

<p>
In order to avoid this problem, standard commands do not include the
dash (<tt>-</tt>) character. Private extensions are recommended to be of
the form <tt>XXX-YYYYY</tt>, where <tt>XXX</tt> is a prefix which is
sufficiently unique for the engine or controller in question, and
<tt>YYYYY</tt> describes the command. E.g. a private variant of the
<tt>genmove</tt> command used by GNU Go could be called
<tt>gg-genmove</tt>.

</p><p>
Engines are allowed to use private extensions without a dash in the
name, but then they do it at their own risk and must be prepared to
change if the name later becomes used for a standard command.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000314000000000000000">
2.14 Panic Situations</a>
</h2>
If an engine for some reason, e.g. an internal error, finds itself in a
position where it cannot meaningfully continue the session, the correct
action is to just close the connection. This is also what typically will
happen if the program should happen to encounter an uncontrolled crash.

<a name="sec:preprocessing"></a>
<br>
3.1 Preprocessing
</h2>

<p>
When a command string arrives to an engine, it is expected to perform
the following four operations before any further parsing takes place:

</p><ol>
<li><a name="it:remove-control"></a> Remove all occurences of CR and other
  control characters except for HT and LF.
</li>
<li>For each line with a hash sign (#), remove all text following and
  including this character.
</li>
<li><a name="it:convert-ht"></a> Convert all occurences of HT to SPACE.
</li>
<li>Discard any empty or white-space only lines.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When a response arrives to a controller, it is expected only to do steps
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#it:remove-control">1</a> and <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#it:convert-ht">3</a> above.

</p><p>
Naturally an implementation does not have to actually do this
preprocessing as a separate step but may interleave it with other
parts of the parsing. For purposes of the following specifications,
though, the preprocessing is supposed to have been carried out in
full.

<p>
With fixed placement the handicap stones are set in predetermined

board size but is never larger than 9. On a 19x19 board, the positions
for the handicap stones are given by this table:

</p><p>

</tbody></table> 
<br>
</p><p>
The placement of handicap stones on other board sizes mirrors that of
19x19 with stones at a specific distance from the edges and on the
middle lines of the board, with the following caveats:

</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>For boards smaller than 13x13, the edge stones are placed on the third
  line instead of on the fourth line.
</li>
<li>For boards of even size there is no middle line and therefore no
  handicaps larger than 4.
</li>
<li>Boards of size 7x7 have at most 4 handicap stones.
</li>
<li>No handicap for boards smaller than 7x7.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
4.1.2 Free Handicap Placement
</h3>

<p>
With free placement the handicap stones are set as chosen by the
controller or by one of the engines (for normal tournament use the
engine playing the black stones would make the choice). The smallest
number of handicap stones is 2. The highest number is one less the
number of vertices on the board. However, when the number of handicap
stones becomes very high there is no benefit in additional stones.
Therefore, when asked to choose handicap placement, an engine is
allowed to return a smaller number of stones than requested. This
provision should only be used if the requested number of stones is so
high that a smaller number of stones is believed to guarantee that the
engine cannot possibly lose against any opponent.

4.2 Time Handling
</h2>

<p>
The protocol has support for Canadian byo yomi, including absolute
time (no byo yomi) as a special case. Canadian byo yomi is
characterized by the three parameters

</p><ul>
<li>Main time <img width="18" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img3.gif" alt="$m$">,

</ul>
The semantics is that the clock is first set to <img width="18" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img3.gif" alt="$m$">. The
engine has no requirements on the number of stones while this time is
running. When it is up, the clock is reset to <img width="11" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img4.gif" alt="$b$"> and the
engine has to play <img width="12" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img5.gif" alt="$s$"> stones before this time is up. When <img width="12" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img5.gif" alt="$s$"> stones

the time is up. This procedure repeats until the game is over. If an
engine fails to play <img width="12" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img5.gif" alt="$s$"> stones before its byo yomi time is up, it
loses on time.

<p>
Setting <img width="47" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Specification of the Go Text Protocol, version 2, draft 2_files/img6.gif" alt="$m=0$"> means that the engine immediately starts in byo yomi.

4.3 Scoring
</h2>

<p>
Depending on the exact choice of rules (see also section
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:missing-features">8.3</a>), scoring a finished game may be more or
less complex. With a few exceptions it is critical to determine which
stones are dead and which are alive. Sometimes it is also necessary to
distinguish between life in seki and independent life.

</p><p>
This protocol provides two commands to query the engines about score
and group status. They are both valid only when the game is finished.

</p><p>
The first command, <tt>final_score</tt>, asks for the engine's
opinion about the score. The result is returned as a string of the
form <tt>W+2.5</tt> if white wins, <tt>B+31</tt> if black wins, and
just <tt>0</tt> if the game ends in a draw. The number in the result
is of course the difference between the number of points for each
player, including komi.

</p><p>
The second command, <tt>final_status_list</tt>, is used to query an
engine about the status of the stones. This command takes a string
argument which may be one of <tt>alive</tt>, <tt>seki</tt>, and
<tt>dead</tt>. The result is reported by listing all stones having the
requested status. The list is organized with one string per line. If
an engine cannot distinguish between life in seki and independent
life, all those stones should be reported as alive.

</p><p>
The protocol does not include any support for resolving disagreement
about status or score.

8.1 Design Principles</a>
</h2>

<ol>
<li><a name="it:design-machine"></a> The protocol is primarily intended for
  machine-machine communication. At the same time we want it to be
  reasonably human readable as well. There are two principal reasons
  for this. The first one is to make it easy to debug a protocol
  implementation or to find the error if the communication breaks
  down, e.g. if two engines involved in a game get their boards out
  of sync. The second reason is to make it easy to online issue GTP
  commands, or write scripts, for engine testing.

<p>
The protocol is <i>not</i> intended as a user interface for playing
  games though, even if it can be done for testing purposes.

</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>The protocol intentionally does not include any negotiation
  options. The controller dictates everything and the engine has to
  comply, unless it is technically unable to, in which case it has to
  fail. While this to some extent limits the power of the protocol, it
  considerably simplifies implementation of both engines and
  controllers.

<p>
Arguably an engine could fail on purpose as some kind of attempt to
  force negotiation. This is not encouraged and is considered bad
  style. A controller has absolutely no obligation to try to work
  around such failures.
</p></li>
</ol>

<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:communication-model">1.3</a> Communication Model</b>
<br>
That the controller initiates all communication does not imply that
  it has to set up the communication <i>channel</i>.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:character-set">2.1</a> Character Set</b>
<br>
ASCII specifies characters in the interval 0-127, some of which are
  control characters. ``Other characters'' refer to characters in the
  interval 128-255, which are available in various character sets
  such as the ISO-8859-x series.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:whitespace">2.3</a> Whitespace</b>
<br>
The requirement to accept both SPACE and HT but only produce SPACE
  applies to both engine and controller. The reason for this asymmetry
  is that SPACE is the preferred character but since it for some
  purposes can be convenient to write scripts of GTP commands manually
  in text files it is conceivable that an HT may occur occasionally.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:newline-convention">2.4</a> Newline Convention</b>
<br>
The newline convention is easy to implement and allows
  interoperability between platforms using LF, CRLF, or LFCR to
  indicate newlines. It does not interoperate with the CR only
  convention used in text files on MacOS, prior to MacOS X. This is
  not expected to be a substantial problem.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:timing">2.8</a> Timing</b>
<br>
While the communication channels are required to be free from
  errors, we do not assume that they are free from delays. For
  communication over the internet, random delays are a reality and it
  would be unrealistic not to take this into account.

<p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:comments">2.9</a> Comments</b>

<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:board-coordinates">2.11</a> Board Coordinates</b>
<br>
The choice of board coordinates is guided by design principle
  <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#it:design-machine">1</a> of the previous section. The alternative to
  instead use a pair of integers is slightly easier for a machine to
  parse and does not impose any limitations on the maximum board size.
  However, the better human readibility of the chosen format is
  considered significant enough.

<p>
This coordinate convention is identical to the one used on IGS and
  many other go servers, and is also used in the specification of the
  Go Modem Protocol.

</p><p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:simple-entities">3.2.1</a> Simple Entities</b> 
<br>
The only purpose of the <tt>float</tt> entity is to specify komi
  values. In practice it would suffice to restrict these to small
  integers and half-integers, but it is probably better to allow
  general floating point numbers anyway.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:compound-entities">3.2.2</a> Compound Entities</b> 
<br>
Since a list can only be stopped by an LF, an entity like
  <tt>{int* color*}</tt> is invalid, although it would technically
  be possible to tell the ints from the colors in this particular
  case.

<p>
For similar reasons constructions of the form <tt>{x&amp; y&amp;}</tt>
  or <tt>x&amp;*</tt> are also invalid.

</p><p>
The multiline list construction cannot be used for commands since these
  are terminated by a single LF.

</p><p>
In constructions of the form <tt>x*&amp;</tt>, there is no requirement
  that every <tt>x*</tt> has the same length. I.e., there may be
  varying number of elements on each line.

</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:standard-error-messages">3.6</a> Standard Error Messages</b> 
<br>
Failures can be divided into two classes. In the first class we have
  syntactically incorrect commands and other failures of the
  controller to follow the specification. In the second class we have
  technical limitations of the engine, which the controller cannot
  easily foresee in advance.

<p>
Only failures in the second class have standard error messages, on
  the assumption that these are the only ones the controller need to
  take action on. Failures in the first class indicate programming
  errors and will require debugging. Thus those error messages may
  freely be chosen to best help the debugging.

</p><p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:fixed-handicap-placement">4.1.1</a> Fixed Handicap Placement</b> 
<br>
This fixed handicap placement is compatible with the Go Modem
  Protocol and many go servers.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:free-handicap-placement">4.1.2</a> Free Handicap Placement</b> 
<br>
Filling all vertices but one with handicap stones leave them in
  atari and is obviously not attractive for black. Moreover black has
  the trivial placement of half the number of stones in a chessboard
  pattern which leaves white without a single legal move. It is also
  possible to place a smaller number of stones than that so that white
  cannot possibly form a single living group. Thus there clearly
  exists thresholds above which it is not meaningful to add more
  stones.

<p>
With this in mind it is recommended that every engine has a
  threshold of at least 40 stones for 19x19 and a proportional number
  for other board sizes. Extremely weak engines are recommended to
  provide handicap placements all the way up to the full chessboard
  pattern.

</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:time-handling">4.2</a> Time Handling</b> 
<br>
The controller is responsible for measuring time and deciding
  whether an engine has run out of time. The information given by the
  <tt>time_settings</tt> and <tt>time_left</tt> commands is only to
  guide the engines about how fast they need to play.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:scoring">4.3</a> Scoring</b> 
<br>
With most rulesets scoring is difficult for computer programs. Only
  sophisticated engines can be expected to have reliable scoring while
  many engines probably will not implement the scoring commands at
  all. A controller is recommended to have external methods available
  to decide the winner (e.g. an independent trusted program or a
  human reviewer) but there is no reason to invoke them if both
  engines implement the scoring commands and agree about the result.

<p>
The format of the score string is identical to the RE property in
  SGF FF[4].

</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:state-variables">5.1</a> State Variables</b> 
<br>
An engine which never uses some state for anything does not have to
  keep track of it just because it should. The point of the rule is
  that the engine is not allowed to suddenly change any state which it
  does use, unless instructed to.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:default-state">5.2</a> Default State</b> 
<br>
It may seem natural to require e.g. an empty board when the engine
  is started. However, it can also be convenient to be able to start
  the engine with e.g. an sgf file already loaded.

<p>
</p></li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/gtp2-spec-draft2/gtp2-spec.html#sec:regression-commands">6.3.5</a> Regression Commands</b> 
<br>
GNU Go has a wide array of commands used in regression testing, such
  as <tt>attack</tt> to test whether a string can be tactically
  captured. However, except for simple move generation it is not at
  all clear to what extent such commands can be defined in ways which
  are meaningful across multiple programs. It is desired to increase
  the set of standard regression commands in future protocol
  revisions, but it must be done with care.

<p>
The reason for a separate <tt>reg_genmove</tt> command is that it is
  usually desirable to get consistent regression results. I.e. for a
  given position the same move should always be generated. In actual
  play it is useful to have a random variability between moves of
  similar value, in particular in the opening, to avoid playing too
  predictably.

8.3 Missing Features
</h2>

<p>

</p><ol>
<li><b>Ruleset Commands and Scoring Options</b> 
<br>
This version of the protocol has no provisions to specify what
  ruleset and/or scoring options to use. This is planned for future
  revisions but has been omitted here due to the complexity of the
  issue.

<p>
The reason why this is considered complex is that there are numerous
  rulesets (using the term loosely) such as Japanese, Chinese, AGA,
  Ing, IGS, and New Zealand, which differ with respect to one or more
  of ko rule, area or territory scoring, scoring of seki, legality of
  suicide, effect of handicap stones on scoring, and so on.

</p><p>
As a workaround this kind of information has to be passed through
  other channels than GTP, e.g. as command line options when starting
  the engine.

</p><p>
In practice this is not all that much of a problem since these
  settings rarely vary between games, e.g. within a tournament. Still
  it is desirable to have this functionality in the protocol, but it
  is worth waiting for a well thought through design of the commands.

</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>Introspective Commands</b> 
<br>
GNU Go includes a large number of commands to query the board, e.g. 
  list legal moves, find connected strings, count liberties, and so
  on. These can be useful when writing a ``stupid'' user interface
  which does not itself know anything about the board logic. They have
  been omitted from this specification mainly to keep it shorter and
  make it look less imposing. They are under consideration for
  inclusion in later revisions.

</p><p>
A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

</p><p>
The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice

to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

</p><p>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000114000000000000000">
10.3 Copying in Quantity</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

</p><p>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

</p><p>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

</p><p>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000115000000000000000">
10.4 Modifications</a>
</h2>

<p>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
</li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</li>
<li>Preserve the section entitled ``History'', and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</li>
<li>In any section entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
</li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</li>
<li>Delete any section entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
</li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section as ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

<p>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

</p><p>
You may add a section entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties - for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

</p><p>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

</p><p>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000116000000000000000">
10.5 Combining Documents</a>
</h2>

<p>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

</p><p>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

</p><p>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
entitled ``Endorsements.''

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000117000000000000000">
10.6 Collections of Documents</a>
</h2>

<p>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

</p><p>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000118000000000000000">
10.7 Aggregation With Independent Works</a>
</h2>

<p>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an ``aggregate'', and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

</p><p>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION000119000000000000000">
10.8 Translation</a>
</h2>

<p>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION0001110000000000000000">
10.9 Termination</a>
</h2>

<p>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION0001111000000000000000">
10.10 Future Revisions of This License</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

</p><p>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION0001112000000000000000">
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</a>
</h2>

<p>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>Copyright © YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
      Free Documentation License''.
</blockquote>
<p>

</p><p>
If you have no Invariant Sections, write ``with no Invariant Sections''
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write ``no Front-Cover Texts'' instead of
``Front-Cover Texts being LIST''; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

</p><p>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
