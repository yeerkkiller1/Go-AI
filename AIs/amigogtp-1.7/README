AmiGoGtp is a version of the AmiGo Go program with a Go Text Protocol
interface added.

AmiGo was one of the first Go programs publicly available with source code.
It is based on a Pascal program written by Stoney Ballard in 1983 and posted
to USENET and was ported to C and the Amiga by Todd R. Johnson in 1989.

AmiGo plays weak compared with newer programs. The purpose of this release
is to make AmiGo available as a reference player. Therefore only small
changes to the original source code were made:

- Small bug fixes
- Fixes for compiler warnings
- Less deterministic play
- Support for board sizes from 9 to 19
- Support for superko rules (used at computer Go servers)

The source code should compile on any standard C++ platform. It includes
configuration files for a build using GNU Autotools. See INSTALL for details.
To use AmigoGtp in the GoGui graphical interface (http://gogui.sf.net),
select "New Program" from the "Program" menu and enter the location of the
amigogtp executable in the command field.
